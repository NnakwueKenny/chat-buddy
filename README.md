# Chat Buddy

A web app built built entirely with Javascript & TailwindCSS (MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React,js and Node.js) to showcase my skill in the aforementioned area(https://github.com/NnakwueKenny/chat-buddy).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
